//		Git is a way of communicating your code to a central storage place or repository that allows others who are
//		working with you to access and use the most up to date code. A Git workflow is a system for saving and versioning
//		your programming work. There is no right way to create a git workflow; the choice is up to you. Ideally, you and 
//		your team members determine what system or pattern works best.  
//		
//		A good workflow includes designing the branches of your repository so you always know who is working on what 
//		functionality or feature of your project. Once the code has reached a clean, saveable state, each person  
//		pushes their working code to their branch.
//		
//		After everyone's work has been saved to their branch, you'll create pull requests to get your branch and its
//		updated code pulled to a main branch. Sometimes this is a pre-production branch so that clean code is always
//		pushed to your production environment. Merges don't always go smoothly. Sometimes you'll have conflicts, 
//		but if you review the conflicts, you'll be able to identify the information to keep and then to finish merging
//		the information to your main branch.
//		
//		Generally a workflow will also address when and how your branches are pushed to your production environment.
//		You always want to make sure the tested and clean code goes to your production branch/environment.
