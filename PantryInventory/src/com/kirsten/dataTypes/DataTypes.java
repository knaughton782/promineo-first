//		Java is a statically typed language which means all the variable types are stated in the variable declaration 
//		statement. These are called data types and define the values a variable can hold. These values are stored in the
//		computer memory to be used later in the program. There are 8 primitive data types in Java. These are byte, short, 
//		int, long, float, double, boolean, and char. 
//		
//		The boolean data type has two possible values: true or false. This is very useful for many programming scenarios
//		that include yes/no, up/down, on/off, or true/false.
//		
//		The char data type can hold 16-bit Unicode characters which is usually a single character. 
//		
//		The remaining data types hold some kind of number or arithmetic types. Byte is 8 bits on size while a short data
//		type will hold 16 bits of data. The most commonly used number data type is int which can hold a large range of 
//		positive or negative numbers. The long data type is similar to int, but it can hold a much large number value.
//		The float data type allows you to use decimals and can hold 32 bits of data. It is a much more precise type of
//		number. The double data type also allows decimals and is even more precise that the float type because it can
//		hold larger amounts of data. It is the default data type for holding decimal values.
//		
//		There is an additional important data type called String. This type allows the programmer to store long strings 
//		characters in text format.
